## TELEPROMPTER TEXT

### SEGMENT 1: About Our Startup (15 seconds)

Adt Infra Hub is Moldova's first enterprise infrastructure management platform. We unify Kubernetes, AWS, and bare-metal server management through a single interface. We manage over 1,000 servers handling 6+ million requests per second for Adtelligent - a supply-side ad tech platform serving programmatic advertising at global scale, achieving 99.8% uptime.

---

### SEGMENT 2: How the Idea Came About (15 seconds)

The idea came from real pain. Since 2008, we grew Adtelligent - a supply-side ad tech company - from a startup with manual deployments to an enterprise serving programmatic advertising at 6 million requests per second across EU, USA, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan. We went through major migrations - NodeJS to Go, MongoDB to ClickHouse, monolith to microservices. We evolved to YAML-based inventories, but still managed infrastructure with scattered scripts. We needed one unified platform.

---

### SEGMENT 3: The Problem We Solve (15 seconds)

As we scaled from 100 servers in 2015 to hundreds today, we hit the wall: scattered bash scripts, YAML inventories, multiple monitoring tools, zero visibility. Every company faces this. We built Adt Infra Hub to replace all of that with one platform - delivering 40% efficiency gains and 10-15% cost reduction.

---

### SEGMENT 4: What Makes Us Different (15 seconds)

Our innovation is AI-powered predictive analytics combined with a zero-impact monitoring agent. We don't just monitor infrastructure - we predict failures before they happen, forecast costs, and automatically optimize resources. It's infrastructure that thinks ahead.

---

### SEGMENT 5: Concrete Results (15 seconds)

We manage $150,000 per month in infrastructure costs, achieving 10-15% savings - over $200,000 annually. We built a full NOC department with L1-L4 response levels, unified inventory system, and automatic billing scraping and integration across more than 5 global hosting providers we use. Our platform replaced years of technical debt with one interface.

---

### SEGMENT 6: Contribution to Moldova's IT Sector (15 seconds)

In 2023, we made Moldova a strategic part of Adtelligent's global infrastructure. Our 100% Moldova-based team of 15+ engineers built this enterprise platform from Chișinău. We're proving that world-class solutions solving multi-million dollar problems can come from Moldova - and compete globally.

---

### SEGMENT 7: What This Nomination Means (20 seconds)

Being nominated for the MITP Awards validates that Moldova can compete globally in enterprise software. My message to other startups: don't wait for perfect conditions. Solve real problems with authentic experience, execute relentlessly, and the world will notice. Moldova has the talent - we just need the courage to compete.
